# Breast Cancer Detection System using CNN

This project is an AI-powered breast cancer detection system that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze breast scan images and predict whether the tumor is **Benign** or **Malignant**. The system integrates a **Flask backend** for deep learning inference with a **React (Vite + TypeScript) frontend** for image upload and real-time result visualization.
